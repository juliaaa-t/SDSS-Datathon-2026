# SDSS-Datathon-2026

## Overview
Toronto is one of the most expensive cities in Canada, with individuals facing rising rent, tuition, and basic living expenses. Due to this, many Canadians are concerned about their financial well-being. Particularly, as of 2025, approximately 49% of workers cite financial stability as their primary stressor, with 40% constantly worrying about their future (Benefits Canada). This stress directly reduces workplace productivity & has a significant mental health impact. This submission quantifies which variables strongly predict long-term financial stability. By leveraging data from the Survey of Financial Stability from Statistics Canada, a hybrid stacked model composed of a logistic regression with regularization and gradient boosting was created. The slideshow (SDSS Datathon Personal Finance.pdf) provides an overview of the data, model, and a conclusion to assist households in managing financial stress.
